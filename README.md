# intersection_observer_API_task

nice recruitment task let's go!
The requirements: 
- There is an HTML document with an article extracted from Wikipedia: https://gist.github.com/warpech/f607480c6a0f14452d8bde3cb1f0cd84
- Your task is to add a graphical effect to this document while scrolling, using Intersection Observer API. For example, change the background color when the user scrolls between the sections of the article.
- Deliver the result as a GitHub repo or in a playground like JSFiddle, CodeSandbox, etc.
- Don't overdo it. I assume that the task will not take more than 2 hours.
