            The <strong>speed of light</strong> in <a href="/wiki/Vacuum" title="Vacuum">vacuum</a>, commonly denoted <strong>c</strong>, is a universal
            <a href="/wiki/Physical_constant" title="Physical constant">physical constant</a> important in many areas of <a href="/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a>. Its exact value is defined as 299792458 metres per second (approximately 300000
            km/s, or 186000 mi/s).<a href="#cite_note-imperial-4">[Note 3]</a> It is exact because, by international agreement, a
            <a href="/wiki/Metre#Speed_of_light_definition" title="Metre">metre</a> is defined as the length of the path travelled by <a href="/wiki/Light" title="Light">light</a> in vacuum during a time

            <a href="/wiki/Second" title="Second">second</a>.<a href="#cite_note-6">[Note 4]</a><a href="#cite_note-penrose-7">[3]</a> According to
            <a href="/wiki/Special_relativity" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a>, c is the upper limit for the speed at which conventional <a href="/wiki/Matter" title="Matter">matter</a>, energy or any <a href="/wiki/Signal" title="Signal">signal</a>            carrying information can travel through <a href="/wiki/Space#Relativity" title="Space">space</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though this speed is most commonly associated with light, it is also the speed at which all <a href="/wiki/Massless_particle" title="Massless particle">massless particles</a> and
            <a href="/wiki/Field_(physics)" title="Field (physics)">field</a> perturbations travel in vacuum, including
            <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> (of which light is a small range in the frequency spectrum) and
            <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_wave" title="Gravitational wave">gravitational waves</a>. Such particles and waves travel at c regardless of the motion of the source or the
            <a href="/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference" title="Inertial frame of reference">inertial reference frame</a> of the observer. Particles with nonzero
            <a href="/wiki/Rest_mass" title="Rest mass">rest mass</a> can approach c, but can never actually reach it, regardless of the frame of reference in which their speed is measured. In the
            <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_relativity" title="Theory of relativity">special and general theories of relativity</a>, c interrelates <a href="/wiki/Spacetime" title="Spacetime">space and time</a>, and also appears in the famous equation of

          >
          In some cases objects or waves may appear to travel <a href="#Faster-than-light_observations_and_experiments">faster than light</a> (e.g.
            <a href="/wiki/Phase_velocities" title="Phase velocities">phase velocities</a> of waves,

            The speed at which light propagates through <a href="/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency" title="Transparency and translucency">transparent materials</a>, such as glass or air, is less than c; similarly, the speed of <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_waves"
                title="Electromagnetic waves">electromagnetic waves</a> in wire cables is slower than c. The ratio between c and the speed v at which light travels in a material is called the <a href="/wiki/Refractive_index" title="Refractive index">refractive index</a>            n of the material (<em>n</em> = <em>c</em> / <em>v</em>). For example, for <a href="/wiki/Visible_light" title="Visible light">visible light</a>, the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5, meaning that light in glass travels at
            c / 1.5 ≈ 200000 km/s (124000 mi/s); the <a href="/wiki/Refractive_index_of_air" title="Refractive index of air">refractive index of air</a> for visible light is about 1.0003, so the speed of light in air is about 90 km/s (56 mi/s) slower
            than c.

            For many practical purposes, light and other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. In communicating with distant
            <a href="/wiki/Space_probes" title="Space probes">space probes</a>, it can take minutes to hours for a message to get from Earth to the spacecraft, or vice versa. The light seen from stars left them many years ago, allowing the study of the
            history of the universe by looking at distant objects. The finite speed of light also ultimately limits the data transfer between the CPU and memory chips in <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a>. The speed of light can be
            used with
            <a href="/wiki/Time_of_flight" title="Time of flight">time of flight</a> measurements to measure large distances to high precision.

            <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_relativity" title="Theory of relativity">theory of relativity</a> and in doing so showed that the parameter c had relevance outside of the context of light and electromagnetism.

            After centuries of increasingly precise measurements, in 1975 the speed of light was known to be 299792458 m/s (983571056 ft/s; 186282.397 mi/s) with a

            The speed of light in vacuum is usually denoted by a lowercase <em>c</em>, for &quot;constant&quot; or the Latin
            <em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/celeritas" title="wikt:celeritas">celeritas</a></em> (meaning &quot;swiftness, celerity&quot;). In 1856,

            <em>c</em> for a different constant that was later shown to equal √2 times the speed of light in vacuum. Historically, the symbol <em>V</em> was used as an alternative symbol for the speed of light, introduced by <a href="/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell"
                title="James Clerk Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> in 1865. In 1894,
            <a href="/wiki/Paul_Drude" title="Paul Drude">Paul Drude</a> redefined <em>c</em> with its modern meaning. <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Einstein</a> used <em>V</em> in his <a href="/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_papers" title="Annus Mirabilis papers">original German-language papers</a>            on special relativity in 1905, but in 1907 he switched to <em>c</em>, which by then had become the standard symbol for the speed of light.<a href="#cite_note-Yc-11">[7]</a><a href="#cite_note-12">[8]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes <em>c</em> is used for the speed of waves in <em>any</em> material medium, and _c_0 for the speed of light in vacuum.<a href="#cite_note-handbook-13">[9]</a> This subscripted notation, which is endorsed in official SI literature,
            <a href="#cite_note-BIPM_SI_units-14">[10]</a> has the same form as other related constants: namely, _μ_0 for the
            <a href="/wiki/Vacuum_permeability" title="Vacuum permeability">vacuum permeability</a> or magnetic constant, _ε_0 for the
            <a href="/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity" title="Vacuum permittivity">vacuum permittivity</a> or electric constant, and _Z_0 for the

            The speed at which light waves propagate in vacuum is independent both of the motion of the wave source and of the

        It is only possible to verify experimentally that the two-way speed of light (for example, from a source to a mirror and back again) is frame-independent, because it is impossible to measure the

            Special relativity has many counterintuitive and experimentally verified implications.<a href="#cite_note-27">[21]</a> These include the
            <a href="/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence" title="Mass–energy equivalence">equivalence of mass and energy</a> (<em>E</em> = _mc_2),

            <em>γ</em> from 1 is negligible for speeds much slower than <em>c</em>, such as most everyday speeds—in which case special relativity is closely approximated by
            <a href="/wiki/Galilean_relativity" title="Galilean relativity">Galilean relativity</a>—but it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges to infinity as <em>v</em> approaches <em>c</em>. For example, a time dilation factor of <em>γ</em>            = 2 occurs at a relative velocity of 86.6% of the speed of light (<em>v</em> = 0.866 <em>c</em>). Similarly, a time dilation factor of

            According to special relativity, the energy of an object with <a href="/wiki/Rest_mass" title="Rest mass">rest mass</a> <em>m</em> and speed <em>v</em> is given by _γmc_2, where <em>γ</em> is the Lorentz factor defined above.

        More generally, it is impossible for signals or energy to travel faster than <em>c</em>. One argument for this follows from the counter-intuitive implication of special relativity known as the
        <a href="/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity" title="Relativity of simultaneity">relativity of simultaneity</a>. If the spatial distance between two events A and B is greater than the time interval between them multiplied by <em>c</em> then there
            are frames of reference in which A precedes B, others in which B precedes A, and others in which they are simultaneous. As a result, if something were travelling faster than <em>c</em> relative to an inertial frame of reference, it would be
            travelling backwards in time relative to another frame, and
            <a href="/wiki/Causality_(physics)" title="Causality (physics)">causality</a> would be violated.<a href="#cite_note-47">[Note 9]</a><a href="#cite_note-Taylor_p74-48">[39]</a> In such a frame of reference, an &quot;effect&quot; could be observed

            There are situations in which it may seem that matter, energy, or information-carrying signal travels at speeds greater than <em>c</em>, but they do not. For example, as is discussed in the
            <a href="#In_a_medium">propagation of light in a medium</a> section below, many wave velocities can exceed <em>c</em>. For example, the
            <a href="/wiki/Phase_velocity" title="Phase velocity">phase velocity</a> of <a href="/wiki/X-ray" title="X-ray">X-rays</a> through most glasses can routinely exceed <em>c</em>,<a href="#cite_note-50">[41]</a

        but phase velocity does not determine the velocity at which waves convey information.<a href="#cite_note-51">[42]</a>

        <p>
            If a laser beam is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light can move faster than <em>c</em>, although the initial movement of the spot is delayed because of the time it takes light to get to the distant object at the speed
            <em>c</em>. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speed <em>c</em> from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object
            can be made to move faster than <em>c</em>, after a delay in time.<a href="#cite_note-52">[43]</a

            Certain quantum effects appear to be transmitted instantaneously and therefore faster than <em>c</em>, as in the <a href="/wiki/EPR_paradox" title="EPR paradox">EPR paradox</a>. An example involves the <a href="/wiki/Quantum_state" title="Quantum state">quantum states</a>            of two particles that can be <a href="/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" title="Quantum entanglement">entangled</a>.

            particle will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.<a href="#cite_note-Gibbs-53">[44]</a><a href="#cite_note-54">[45]</a>

            Another quantum effect that predicts the occurrence of faster-than-light speeds is called the <a href="/wiki/Hartman_effect" title="Hartman effect">Hartman effect</a>: under certain conditions the time needed for a <a href="/wiki/Virtual_particle"

            So-called <a href="/wiki/Superluminal_motion" title="Superluminal motion">superluminal motion</a> is seen in certain astronomical objects,<a href="#cite_note-58">[49]</a> such as the

            <a href="/wiki/Graphical_projection" title="Graphical projection">projection</a> effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the

        <p>
            In models of the expanding universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. This receding is not due to motion <em>through</em> space, but rather to the

        <p>
            In modern <a href="/wiki/Quantum_physics" title="Quantum physics">quantum physics</a>, the electromagnetic field is described by the theory of
            <a href="/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics" title="Quantum electrodynamics">quantum electrodynamics</a> (QED). In this theory, light is described by the fundamental excitations (or quanta) of the electromagnetic field, called <a href="/wiki/Photon"
                title="Photon">photons</a>. In QED, photons are <a href="/wiki/Massless_particle" title="Massless particle">massless particles</a> and thus, according to special relativity, they travel at the speed of light in vacuum.
        </p>
        <p>
            Extensions of QED in which the photon has a mass have been considered. In such a theory, its speed would depend on its frequency, and the invariant speed <em>c</em> of special relativity would then be the upper limit of the speed of light
            in vacuum.<a href="#cite_note-Gibbs1997-35">[27]</a> No variation of the speed of light with frequency has been observed in rigorous testing,<a href="#cite_note-Schaefer-62">[53]</a

        </p>
        <p>
            Another reason for the speed of light to vary with its frequency would be the failure of special relativity to apply to arbitrarily small scales, as predicted by some proposed theories of

            In a medium, light usually does not propagate at a speed equal to <em>c</em>; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a <a href="/wiki/Plane_wave" title="Plane wave">plane wave</a>            (a wave filling the whole space, with only one <a href="/wiki/Frequency" title="Frequency">frequency</a>) propagate is called the <a href="/wiki/Phase_velocity" title="Phase velocity">phase velocity</a> _v_p. A physical signal with a finite
            extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the <a href="/wiki/Group_velocity" title="Group velocity">group velocity</a> _v_g, and its earliest part travels at the

        </p>
        <p>
            The phase velocity is important in determining how a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented in terms of a <em>refractive index</em>. The refractive index of a material is defined as the
            ratio of <em>c</em> to the phase velocity _v_p in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light&#39;s frequency, intensity, <a href="/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"
                title="Polarization (waves)">polarization</a>, or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. The <a href="/wiki/Refractive_index_of_air" title="Refractive index of air">refractive index of air</a>            is approximately 1.0003.<a href="#cite_note-Podesta-68">[59]</a

            materials like <a href="/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate" title="Bose–Einstein condensate">Bose–Einstein condensates</a> near absolute zero, the effective speed of light may be only a few metres per second. However, this represents absorption
            and re-radiation delay between atoms, as do all slower-than-<em>c</em> speeds in material substances. As an extreme example of light &quot;slowing&quot; in matter, two independent teams of physicists claimed to bring light to a &quot;complete
            standstill&quot; by passing it through a Bose–Einstein condensate of the element <a href="/wiki/Rubidium" title="Rubidium">rubidium</a>. However, the popular description of light being &quot;stopped&quot; in these experiments refers only to
            light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrarily later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had &quot;stopped&quot;, it had ceased to be light. This type of behaviour is generally

        <p>
            In transparent materials, the refractive index generally is greater than 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than <em>c</em>. In other materials, it is possible for the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies;
            in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative.<a href="#cite_note-73">[64]</a> The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the <a href="/wiki/Real_and_imaginary_parts" title="Real and imaginary parts">real and imaginary parts</a>            of the

        <p>
            A pulse with different group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity is not the same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears out over time, a process known as
            <a href="/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)" title="Dispersion (optics)">dispersion</a>. Certain materials have an exceptionally low (or even zero) group velocity for light waves, a phenomenon called

            When light is travelling around the globe in an <a href="/wiki/Optical_fibre" title="Optical fibre">optical fibre</a>, the actual transit time is longer, in part because the speed of light is slower by about 35% in an optical fibre, depending
            on its refractive index <em>n</em>.<a href="#cite_note-85">[Note 10]</a> Furthermore, straight lines rarely occur in global communications situations, and delays are created when the signal passes through an electronic switch or signal regenerator.

            Similarly, communications between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There is a brief delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for communications between
            <a href="/wiki/Mission_Control_Center" title="Mission Control Center">ground control</a> and
            <a href="/wiki/Apollo_8" title="Apollo 8">Apollo 8</a> when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least three seconds for the answer to arrive.<a href="#cite_note-87">[77]</a>            The communications delay between Earth and <a href="/wiki/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a> can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets.<a href="#cite_note-88">[78]</a> As a consequence of this,
            if a robot on the surface of Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for
            instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.

            Receiving light and other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer. For example, it has taken 13 billion (13×109) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the <a href="/wiki/Hubble_Ultra_Deep_Field"

        <p>
            There are different ways to determine the value of <em>c</em>. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which can be done in various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine
            <em>c</em> from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants
            <a href="/wiki/Relative_permittivity" title="Relative permittivity">_ε_0</a> and <a href="/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)" title="Permeability (electromagnetism)">_μ_0</a> and using their relation to <em>c</em>. Historically, the most
            accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling
            <em>c</em>.[_<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a>_]
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1983 the metre was defined as &quot;the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1⁄299792458 of a second&quot;,<a href="#cite_note-Resolution_1-98">[88]</a> fixing the value of the speed of light at 299792458
            m/s by definition, as <a href="#Increased_accuracy_of_c_and_redefinition_of_the_metre_and_second">described below</a>. Consequently, accurate measurements of the speed of light yield an accurate realization of the metre rather than an accurate
            value of <em>c</em>.

        <p>
            <a href="/wiki/Outer_space" title="Outer space">Outer space</a> is a convenient setting for measuring the speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect
            <a href="/wiki/Vacuum" title="Vacuum">vacuum</a>. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the
            <a href="/wiki/Solar_system" title="Solar system">solar system</a>, such as the <a href="/wiki/Radius" title="Radius">radius</a> of the Earth&#39;s orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately
            the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units. It is customary to express the results in
            <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_unit" title="Astronomical unit">astronomical units</a> (AU) per day.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="/wiki/Ole_Christensen_R%C3%B8mer" title="Ole Christensen Rømer">Ole Christensen Rømer</a> used an astronomical measurement to make
            <a href="/wiki/R%C3%B8mer%27s_determination_of_the_speed_of_light" title="Rømer&#39;s determination of the speed of light">the first quantitative estimate of the speed of light</a> in the year 1676.
            <a href="#cite_note-cohen-99">[89]</a><a href="#cite_note-roemer-100">[90]</a> When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from
            it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance
            being the <a href="/wiki/Diameter" title="Diameter">diameter</a> of the Earth&#39;s orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon&#39;s orbital period is caused by the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or
            longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for <a href="/wiki/Jupiter" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>&#39;s innermost moon <a href="/wiki/Io_(moon)" title="Io (moon)">Io</a> and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the
            Earth&#39;s orbit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another method is to use the <a href="/wiki/Aberration_of_light" title="Aberration of light">aberration of light</a>, discovered and explained by
            <a href="/wiki/James_Bradley" title="James Bradley">James Bradley</a> in the 18th century.<a href="#cite_note-Bradley1729-101">[91]</a> This effect results from the
            <a href="/wiki/Vector_addition" title="Vector addition">vector addition</a> of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the
            light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth&#39;s velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect
            causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 <a href="/wiki/Arcsecond" title="Arcsecond">arcseconds</a>)<a href="#cite_note-102">[92]</a> it is possible to express
            the speed of light in terms of the Earth&#39;s velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled
            10210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.<a href="#cite_note-Bradley1729-101">[91]</a>

        <h4 id="Astronomical_unit">Astronomical unit</h4>
        <p>
            An astronomical unit (AU) is approximately the average distance between the Earth and Sun. It was redefined in 2012 as exactly 149597870700 m.<a href="#cite_note-AU_redef-103">[93]</a
        ><a href="#cite_note-104">[94]</a> Previously the AU was not based on the
            <a href="/wiki/International_System_of_Units" title="International System of Units">International System of Units</a> but in terms of the gravitational force exerted by the Sun in the framework of classical mechanics.<a href="#cite_note-106">[Note 11]</a>            The current definition uses the recommended value in metres for the previous definition of the astronomical unit, which was determined by measurement.<a href="#cite_note-AU_redef-103">[93]</a> This redefinition is analogous to that of the
            metre and likewise has the effect of fixing the speed of light to an exact value in astronomical units per second (via the exact speed of light in metres per second).
        </p>
        <p>
            Previously, the inverse of <em>c</em> expressed in seconds per astronomical unit was measured by comparing the time for radio signals to reach different spacecraft in the Solar System, with their position calculated from the gravitational
            effects of the Sun and various planets. By combining many such measurements, a <a href="/wiki/Best_fit" title="Best fit">best fit</a> value for the light time per unit distance could be obtained. For example, in 2009, the best estimate, as
            approved by the
            <a href="/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union" title="International Astronomical Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU), was:<a href="#cite_note-Pitjeva09-107">[96]</a

            The relative uncertainty in these measurements is 0.02 parts per billion (2×10−11), equivalent to the uncertainty in Earth-based measurements of length by interferometry.<a href="#cite_note-110">[99]</a
        >
        Since the metre is defined to be the length travelled by light in a certain time interval, the measurement of the light time in terms of the previous definition of the astronomical unit can also
        be interpreted as measuring the length of an AU (old definition) in metres.<a href="#cite_note-111">[Note 12]</a>

            The setup as used by Fizeau consists of a beam of light directed at a mirror 8 kilometres (5 mi) away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap
            on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the
            rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated.<a href="#cite_note-How-112">[100]</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The method of Foucault replaces the cogwheel with a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to the distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the
        rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it is on its way back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of
        light may be calculated.<a href="#cite_note-113">[101]</a>

        <p>
            Nowadays, using <a href="/wiki/Oscilloscopes" title="Oscilloscopes">oscilloscopes</a> with time resolutions of less than one nanosecond, the speed of light can be directly measured by timing the delay of a light pulse from a laser or an LED
            reflected from a mirror. This method is less precise (with errors of the order of 1%) than other modern techniques, but it is sometimes used as a laboratory experiment in college physics classes.<a href="#cite_note-114">[102]</a><a href="#cite_note-115">[103]</a>

            An option for deriving <em>c</em> that does not directly depend on a measurement of the propagation of electromagnetic waves is to use the relation between <em>c</em> and the

            The vacuum permittivity may be determined by measuring the <a href="/wiki/Capacitance" title="Capacitance">capacitance</a> and dimensions of a <a href="/wiki/Capacitor" title="Capacitor">capacitor</a>, whereas the value of the vacuum permeability

        <p>
            Another way to measure the speed of light is to independently measure the frequency <em>f</em> and wavelength <em>λ</em> of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of <em>c</em> can then be found by using the relation <em>c</em> = <em>fλ</em>.
            One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a <a href="/wiki/Cavity_resonator" title="Cavity resonator">cavity resonator</a>. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of
            the wave. In 1946, <a href="/wiki/Louis_Essen" title="Louis Essen">Louis Essen</a> and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of <a href="/wiki/Normal_mode" title="Normal mode">normal modes</a> of microwaves of a

The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8 μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry.<a href="#cite_note-Essen1948-117">[105]</a>            As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from
            <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_theory" title="Electromagnetic theory">electromagnetic theory</a>, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.<a href="#cite_note-Essen1948-117">[105]</a

            The Essen–Gordon-Smith result, 299792±9 km/s, was substantially more precise than those found by optical techniques.<a href="#cite_note-Essen1948-117">[105]</a> By 1950, repeated measurements by Essen established a result of 299792.5±3.0 km/s.

        <p>
            A household demonstration of this technique is possible, using a <a href="/wiki/Microwave_oven" title="Microwave oven">microwave oven</a> and food such as marshmallows or margarine: if the turntable is removed so that the food does not move,
            it will cook the fastest at the <a href="/wiki/Antinode" title="Antinode">antinodes</a> (the points at which the wave amplitude is the greatest), where it will begin to melt. The distance between two such spots is half the wavelength of the
            microwaves; by measuring this distance and multiplying the wavelength by the microwave frequency (usually displayed on the back of the oven, typically 2450 MHz), the value of <em>c</em> can be calculated, &quot;often with less than 5% error&quot;.

        A <a href="/wiki/Coherence_(physics)" title="Coherence (physics)">coherent</a> beam of light (e.g. from a <a href="/wiki/Laser" title="Laser">laser</a>), with a known frequency (<em>f</em>), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By

            <a href="/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)" title="Interference (wave propagation)">interference pattern</a> and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (
            <em>λ</em>) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equation <em>c</em> = <em>λf</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before the advent of laser technology, coherent <a href="/wiki/Radiowave" title="Radiowave">radio</a> sources were used for interferometry measurements of the speed of light.<a href="#cite_note-Froome1858-125">[112]</a
        >
        However interferometric determination of wavelength becomes less precise with wavelength and the experiments were thus limited in precision by the long wavelength (~4 mm (0.16 in)) of the
        radiowaves. The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light. One way around this problem is
        to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked
        to the original signal. A laser can then be locked to the frequency, and its wavelength can be determined using interferometry.<a href="#cite_note-NIST_pub-126">[113]</a> This technique was due to a group at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS)
            (which later became

        Until the <a href="/wiki/Early_modern_period" title="Early modern period">early modern period</a>, it was not known whether light travelled instantaneously or at a very fast finite speed. The
        first extant recorded examination of this subject was in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a>. The ancient Greeks, Muslim scholars, and classical European
        scientists long debated this until Rømer provided the first calculation of the speed of light. Einstein&#39;s Theory of Special Relativity concluded that the speed of light is constant
        regardless of one&#39;s frame of reference. Since then, scientists have provided increasingly accurate measurements.

        light and therefore it should be possible to measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by measuring the isotropy of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several
        experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is

        <a href="/wiki/Hendrik_Lorentz" title="Hendrik Lorentz">Hendrik Lorentz</a> proposed that the motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to

        also be changed accordingly (&quot;local time&quot;), which led to the formulation of the <a href="/wiki/Lorentz_transformation" title="Lorentz transformation">Lorentz transformation</a>. Based
        on <a href="/wiki/Lorentz_ether_theory" title="Lorentz ether theory">Lorentz&#39;s aether theory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9" title="Henri Poincaré">Henri Poincaré</a> (1900) showed
        that this local time (to first order in <em>v</em>/<em>c</em>) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he
        speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz&#39;s theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincaré brought Lorentz&#39;s
        aether theory into full observational agreement with the <a href="/wiki/Principle_of_relativity" title="Principle of relativity">principle of relativity</a>.<a href="#cite_note-160">[146]</a

        In 1905 Einstein postulated from the outset that the speed of light in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the
        principle of relativity as a basis he derived the <a href="/wiki/Special_theory_of_relativity" title="Special theory of relativity">special theory of relativity</a>, in which the speed of light
        in vacuum <em>c</em> featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still
        adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.<a href="#cite_note-162">[148]</a><a href="#cite_note-163">[149]</a>

        In the second half of the 20th century, much progress was made in increasing the accuracy of measurements of the speed of light, first by cavity resonance techniques and later by laser
        interferometer techniques. These were aided by new, more precise, definitions of the metre and second. In 1950, <a href="/wiki/Louis_Essen" title="Louis Essen">Louis Essen</a> determined the
        speed as 299792.5±3.0 km/s, using cavity resonance.<a href="#cite_note-Essen1950-120">[108]</a> This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In
        1960, the <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_metre#Krypton_standard" title="History of the metre">metre was redefined</a> in terms of the wavelength of a particular spectral line of krypton-86, and,
        in 1967, the <a href="/wiki/Second" title="Second">second</a> was redefined in terms of the hyperfine transition frequency of the ground state of

        In 1972, using the laser interferometer method and the new definitions, a group at the US
        <a href="/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology" title="National Institute of Standards and Technology">National Bureau of Standards</a> in
        <a href="/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado" title="Boulder, Colorado">Boulder, Colorado</a> determined the speed of light in vacuum to be <em>c</em> = 299792456.2±1.1 m/s. This was 100 times less
        <a href="/wiki/Measurement_uncertainty" title="Measurement uncertainty">uncertain</a> than the previously accepted value. The remaining uncertainty was mainly related to the definition of the
        metre.<a href="#cite_note-167">[Note 15]</a><a href="#cite_note-NIST_heterodyne-127">[114]</a> As similar experiments found comparable results for <em>c</em>, the 15th
        <a href="/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures" title="General Conference on Weights and Measures">General Conference on Weights and Measures</a> in 1975 recommended using the value

        In 1983 the 17th meeting of the
        <a href="/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures" title="General Conference on Weights and Measures">General Conference on Weights and Measures</a> (CGPM) found that wavelengths from
        frequency measurements and a given value for the speed of light are more <a href="/wiki/Reproducibility" title="Reproducibility">reproducible</a> than the previous standard. They kept the 1967
        definition of <a href="/wiki/Second" title="Second">second</a>, so the <a href="/wiki/Caesium" title="Caesium">caesium</a>
        <a href="/wiki/Hyperfine_structure#Use_in_defining_the_SI_second_and_meter" title="Hyperfine structure">hyperfine frequency</a> would now determine both the second and the metre. To do this,
        they redefined the metre as: &quot;The metre is the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 of a second.&quot;<a href="#cite_note-Resolution_1-98"
          >[88]</a
        >
        As a result of this definition, the value of the speed of light in vacuum is exactly 299792458 m/s<a href="#cite_note-Wheeler-169">[154]</a><a href="#cite_note-timeline-170">[155]</a> and has
        become a defined constant in the SI system of units.<a href="#cite_note-Jespersen-17">[13]</a> Improved experimental techniques that, prior to 1983, would have measured the speed of light no
        longer affect the known value of the speed of light in SI units, but instead allow a more precise realization of the metre by more accurately measuring the wavelength of Krypton-86 and other
        light sources.<a href="#cite_note-Adams-171">[156]</a><a href="#cite_note-W_Rindler-172">[157]</a>

        In 2011, the CGPM stated its intention to redefine all seven SI base units using what it calls &quot;the explicit-constant formulation&quot;, where each &quot;unit is defined indirectly by
        specifying explicitly an exact value for a well-recognized fundamental constant&quot;, as was done for the speed of light. It proposed a new, but completely equivalent, wording of the
        metre&#39;s definition: &quot;The metre, symbol m, is the unit of length; its magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum to be equal to exactly 299792458 when
        it is expressed in the SI unit m s−1.&quot;<a href="#cite_note-173">[158]</a> This was one of the changes that was incorporated in the
